# Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient: Training Agents in Continuous Action Space

Among the most exciting applications for Deep Reinforcement Learning is the implementation of intelligent robotics to carry out the execution of processes normally meant for humans.  One of the largest difficulties in this pursuit remains the complexity of real world environments and training the agent's appropriate interaction with it in order to solve intricate problems.  The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm provides a highly effective solution to real world reinforcement learning problems dealing with continuous action spaces.  Built on a deterministic policy gradient algorithm which optimizes a policy based on cumulative reward, DDPG also utilizes experience replay and target and local networks for stabilized learning from Deep Q Network methodology.
